# Code-Dost – Multilingual, Voice-Based AI Debugging Assistant

## 🎯 Project Overview

Code-Dost is an innovative AI-powered debugging assistant designed specifically for Indian engineering students. It transforms English-only programming error messages into culturally relevant, educational explanations in native Indian languages, helping millions of Tier 2/3 students overcome language barriers in programming education.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of Indian students understand programming logic but struggle to debug code because:
- Compiler errors and documentation are exclusively in English
- Existing AI tools provide direct solutions instead of teaching
- Language barriers prevent conceptual understanding
- Academic integrity is compromised by copy-paste solutions

## 💡 Solution

Code-Dost addresses these challenges by:
- **Multilingual Explanations**: Converts technical errors to Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, and Hinglish
- **Voice-Based Learning**: Optional audio explanations for enhanced accessibility
- **Educational Ethics**: Guides students to discover solutions rather than providing direct answers
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Uses familiar analogies and examples from Indian context
- **Academic Integrity**: Promotes learning over copying

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **Error Analyzer**: Processes and categorizes programming errors
- **Language Processor**: Translates technical content with cultural adaptation
- **Learning Guide**: Provides educational guidance while maintaining ethics
- **Voice Engine**: Converts explanations to natural speech

### Technology Stack
- **Amazon Bedrock**: LLM for intelligent code analysis and multilingual explanations
- **Amazon Polly**: Text-to-Speech for Indian regional languages
- **Amazon S3**: Optional temporary session storage
- **IndicTrans2**: Specialized Indian language translation support

## 🎯 Target Impact

### Primary Users
- Engineering students from Tier 2/3 Indian institutions
- Students who understand programming but struggle with English error messages
- Educators teaching programming in multilingual environments

### Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Learning**: Students understand concepts rather than copying solutions
- **Language Accessibility**: Programming education becomes accessible in native languages
- **Academic Integrity**: Reduced cheating through educational guidance
- **Cultural Relevance**: Technical concepts explained through familiar contexts
